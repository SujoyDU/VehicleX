## VehicleX 

This repository includes our code for the paper 'Simulating Content Consistent Vehicle Datasets with Attribute Descent'. If you want to reproduce our results, you will need to 

1) Generate images by VehicleX engine using attribute descent (content level damain apation); 

2) Perform style level domain adaption for generated images; 

3) Train a Re-ID model for style transfered images. 

The code for the first two steps is available on ./VehicleX and ./StyleDA separately.
